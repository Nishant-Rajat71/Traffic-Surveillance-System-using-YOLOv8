Traffic Surveillance and Vehicle Speed Measurement System
Overview
This project implements a high-accuracy traffic surveillance system using deep learning. It detects, classifies, counts, and measures the speed of vehicles in real time from video input (e.g., CCTV feed, dashcam, or recorded footage). The system is based on the YOLOv8x object detection model and includes advanced image preprocessing and post-processing analytics.

Objectives
Detect vehicles in real-time using CCTV or video feeds.

Classify vehicles into categories: car, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle.

Count total vehicles and provide per-category statistics.

Measure vehicle speeds using frame-by-frame centroid tracking and real-world calibration.

Generate structured traffic data for analysis and decision-making.

Assist in traffic signal optimization, congestion control, and accident prevention.
